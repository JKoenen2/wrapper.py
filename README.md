# Overview #
Wrapper.py is an easy to use Minecraft server wrapper for adding extra functionality into the server without modifying
the server jar file. It comes with a relatively simple and straight-forward - yet powerful - plugin API that can be used
to create Bukkit-like plugins without any server modding.
